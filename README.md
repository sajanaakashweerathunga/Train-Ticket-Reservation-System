# Train-Ticket_Reservation_System-Mobile

In response to the growing demand for a streamlined and efficient Train Ticket Reservation System in Sri Lanka, we have developed a comprehensive solution that caters to both back- office operations and traveler needs. Our system is built on a robust client-server architecture, featuring a web application for back-office functions and a mobile application for travelers. This end-to-end Ticket Reservation system offers a range of functionalities designed to enhance the user experience and ensure seamless management of train bookings.

1) User Management
For travelers on the go, our mobile application allows users to create their accounts, utilizing their NIC as a unique identifier. Travelers have the flexibility to modify their accounts and deactivate them as needed. Reactivation of deactivated accounts, however, requires the intervention of a back-office officer, ensuring security.

3) Reservation Management
Travelers can easily create, modify, and cancel reservations through the mobile application, with a summary page presented before any changes are confirmed. This functionality streamlines the booking process, providing greater convenience and control to travelers.

4) View Bookings
Our mobile application also offers travelers the ability to view their existing bookings and access their reservation history. This feature allows users to keep track of their travel plans and provides transparency throughout their journey.

In conclusion, our Ticket Reservation System is a comprehensive solution that enhances the travel experience for both travelers and back-office operators.
